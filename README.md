## üöÄ Getting Started

To get started with ENAPSO, follow these simple steps:

1. Download our free Postman collection with all API calls from this [ENAPSO Postman Collection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/innotrade/enapso-community/main/ENAPSO.postman_collection.json). To download, click on the link and then right-click select "Save As" to save the file to your computer's Downloads folder. You can also find it in the root directory of our GitHub page.

2. Select the appropriate environment based on your requirements:
    * If you want to test the functionalities of our platform, use the  [**Consumer Environment**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/innotrade/enapso-community/main/ENAPSO-Cloud%20(Consumer).postman_environment.json)(open the link and then right-click select "Save As" to save the file). This environment provides read-only rights and is perfect for testing and evaluating ENAPSO before using it in your own applications. Note that this environment is running in our cloud.
    * If you want your own isolated tenant to work with your own data, fill out [this form](https://www.innotrade.com/enapso-tenant-registration) to request access to a tenant. Our support team will assist you in setting it up, and the tenant will be available as a 2-week trial for you to test the functionality. Note that this environment is also running in our cloud.
    * If you want to operate ENAPSO on-premises, such as running it locally in your own Docker instance or Kubernetes environment, contact us at support@innotrade.de, and we can provide you with the credentials to access the images through our container registry. To learn more about how you can deploy ENAPSO services locally, you can follow this [link](https://github.com/innotrade/enapso-community/wiki/ENAPSO-Platform-Services-on-On-Premises-Solutions-with-Kubernetes-and-Docker-Compose).

3. Authenticate yourself by executing the login call. The token returned in the response will automatically be stored in an environment variable.

4. You're all set! Start building your own intelligent and highly-connected applications using ENAPSO.

Note: If you need help with importing Postman collections and environments, you can refer to the documentation available in this [link](https://github.com/innotrade/enapso-community/wiki/Importing-Postman-Collections-&-Environments).

## üîë Authentication and Authorization

Authentication is required before you can use ENAPSO. To authenticate yourself, follow these steps:

1. Select the environment you want to use (Consumer or a custom one).
2. Execute the login call.
3. The token returned in the response will automatically be stored in an environment variable.

Please note that the Consumer environment is configured with read-only rights, providing limited functionality of the APIs. If you are looking to access all the features and extended functionality of ENAPSO, please fill out [this form](https://www.innotrade.com/enapso-tenant-registration) and request your own tenant. Our team will be happy to assist you and help you take full advantage of our platform which would be available as a 2-week trial for you to test the functionality.
